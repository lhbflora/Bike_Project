# Bike_Project

As a good supplement of public traffic, low cost and convenience rental bike is chosen by millions of people on the way to the bus/subway 
station to work or just take a leisure riding. So I propose a project to research how to optimize the existing system and what can we do in
 the future to promote the development of this environmentally friendly industry. According to the data posted, a lot of things can be 
explore. For example,compare to the last-year-data, how does percentage of the subscribers and costomers change. According to this change 
how can we adjust the annual and short time price setting. Or what's near the hottest station such that people are willing to rent the bike 
and to what extent each factor affect the uage. So we can adjust the amount of  bike to be placed in each station. Moreover, in combination 
with the infrastructure construction, where should we build the new station.
